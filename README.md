## Description

>"This is a project based course where we build an extensive, in-depth backend API for DevCamper, a bootcamp directory API. We will start from scratch and end up with a professional deployed API with documentation. We will dive deep into Node, Express and MongoDB. This course will teach you the entire backend side of things so that you can build extensive APIs and then use whatever you want on the frontend."

>"We will do a lot more than just build a simple CRUD REST API like many other Node.js and Express tutorials. We will be implementing authentication, roles and permissions, password reset tokens, email functionality, geocoding and much more."

### What You'll Learn
